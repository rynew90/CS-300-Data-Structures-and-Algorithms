# Data_Structures_and_Algorithms-Analysis_and_Design

1.What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

```In this project I was creating a course finder application for ABC University that would allow a user to print out a sample course schedule in alphanumeric order and search for a specific course in the data file.```

2.How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

```To solve this problem, I utilized a vector data structure to load the contents of the file into vectors. The vector was the easiest and fastest way to sort and save all contents of the data file for use in the application.```

3.How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

```Any issues or "roadblocks" that I encountered were researched using C++ documentation and other sites that explained how to use certain built-in functions. I also utilized Stackoverflow to help with compile or runtime issues that I encountered.```

4.How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

```This project has helped me to understand data structures better and how to utilize them in certain situations where they would be best suited for the problem that is to be solved. It has also allowed me to take time to think about how to implement such data structures in a way that is both efficient and conforms to standard practices.```

5.How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

```This project has tested my knowledge, taught me better practices, and allowed me to expand my knowledge to parts of coding that I have not been able to use up to this point. It has also taught me that comments are important, not only for the readability for others, but for me to remember where I left off from the day before and to remember what my train of thought was when creating certain blocks of code.```
